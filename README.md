# Excel-Project
In this project we took a raw data  about bike buyers .
we clean it and create pivot tables in order to analyse the data by making different connections for example Customer age brackets and their bike buying trend. other was the gender and their marital status affecting the bike buying trend.
One interesting thing that was revealed was the average income of males and females how  it is directly related to their purchase.
